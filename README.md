Introduction
The goal of this project is to estimate bone age from X-ray images using machine learning techniques. We explore two different architectures: VGG16 and XceptionNet. The provided notebooks contain code, data preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation.

Installation
To set up the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/nithin200417/BoneAgeAssessmentDL.git
cd your-repo


Usage
Run the notebooks to explore the following models:

1. Bone Age Assessment using VGG16
File: baa125156154.ipynb
Description: This notebook demonstrates bone age assessment using VGG16 with feature extraction. It covers data loading, preprocessing, model architecture, and evaluation.
2. BAA using XceptionNet
File: newmlbaa.ipynb
Description: Explore BAA using XceptionNet. Compare it with VGG16, discuss differences, and evaluate performance.
3. Comparision of performances of different models in BAA
File: deepmodelsbaa.ipynb
4. The performance of the Densenet101 and Resnet50 and Xceptionnet were demonstrated in the given codes
