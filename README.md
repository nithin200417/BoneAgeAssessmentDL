## Introduction

The goal of this project is to estimate bone age from X-ray images using machine learning techniques. We explore two different architectures: VGG16 and XceptionNet. The provided notebooks contain code, data preprocessing steps, model architecture, and evaluation.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/nithin200417/BoneAgeAssessmentDL.git 

## Usage

Run the notebooks to explore the following models:

1. **Bone Age Assessment using VGG16**
- File: `baa125156154.ipynb`
- Description: This notebook demonstrates bone age assessment using VGG16 with feature extraction. It covers data loading, preprocessing, model architecture, and evaluation.

2. **BAA using XceptionNet**
- File: `newmlbaa.ipynb`
- Description: Explore BAA using XceptionNet. Compare it with VGG16, discuss differences, and evaluate performance.

3. **Comparison of performances of different models in BAA**
- File: `deepmodelsbaa.ipynb`

4. **Performance of Densenet101, Resnet50, and Xceptionnet**
- Files: `deepbaa.ipynb`, `newdensenet.ipynb`, `baausingxception.ipynb`, `deeplove.ipynb`
